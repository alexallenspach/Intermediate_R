#By now, you will probably have a good understanding of the difference between required and optional arguments. Let's refresh this difference by having one last look at the mean() function:

#mean(x, trim = 0, na.rm = FALSE, ...)

#x is required; if you do not specify it, R will throw an error. trim and na.rm are optional arguments: they have a default value which is used if the arguments are not explicitly specified.

#Which of the following statements about the read.table() function are true?

#    header, sep and quote are all optional arguments.
#    row.names and fileEncoding don't have default values.
#    read.table("myfile.txt", "-", TRUE) will throw an error.
#    read.table("myfile.txt", sep = "-", header = TRUE) will throw an error.
